# Quine graphs

Given a graph rewrite system. a graph G is a quine graph if it has a non-void maximal non-conflicting collection of rewrite patterns,  such that after the rewrites from the collection are done in parallel we obtain a graph isomorphic with G. 

We invite you to  explore some of their properties, with examples taken from lambda calculus, interaction combinators and chemlambda.
